# RSMOTE
Oversampling method based on relative density



A self-adaptive robust SMOTE, called RSMOTE, is proposed for imbalanced classification with label noise. In RSMOTE, the minority samples are split into two areas, i.e., borderline area and safe area, based on the 2-means clustering results of the relative density of minority samples. New samples are generated within each cluster. Furthermore, we reweigh the number generated by each minority sample to generate more samples near the safe samples and fewer samples near the chaos samples, to enhance the separability of the classification boundary between classes. RSMOTE does not rely on any specific noise filter nor introduce any extra parameters.
